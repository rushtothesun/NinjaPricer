# NinjaPricer

ExileCore2 Plugin for instant price checking. Originally made by https://github.com/DetectiveSquirrel/

What does it do?
This plugin downloads public price data.
The data can then be used to price check items such as:
- Currency
- Divination Cards
- Essences
- Fragments
- Uniques

The plugin can also show the overall worth of a stash tab or inventory.

Item that aren't available in the data show 0c as price.
Item that have multiple variants show a range between the lowest and highest cost. The plugin can't differentiate between them.
